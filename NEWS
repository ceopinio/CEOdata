Version 1.3.1
------------------------------

  - Make the vignettes safer for CRAN submission, when dealing with Internet
  connection potential problems.

  - Improve the documentation regarding how to deal with the SPSS labelled
  variables that are by default transformed into pure-R factors.


Version 1.3.0.1
------------------------------

  - Solve a bug when leading a single REO the function was not parsing factors
  correctly.


Version 1.3
------------------------------

  - Singular REOs now pass with factors. In addition to that, new tests to
  ensure it.


Version 1.2.0.1
------------------------------

  - Similar to previous version but solving a minor issue with a warning. But to
  mark a milestone a new minor version number is added.


Version 1.1.1
------------------------------

  - Identical to 1.1.0, but needed to resubmit with a different version number
  due to a URL down in the DESCRIPTION.


Version 1.1.0
------------------------------

MAJOR CHANGES

  - Internally the table of metadata from the CEO now has zip files as sources
  of the individual REO studies, instead of the original .sav files. This is
  transparent for the user, though.

MINOR CHANGES

  - The compounded barometer has now a generic URL that will be easier to
  maintain.

  - Variable "INGRESSOS" in the vignettes is now "INGRESSOS_1_15".

  - Added a test on the date of the first barometer, to ensure that the date of
  the compounded barometer is correctly processed.


Version 1.0.4
------------------------------

MINOR CHANGES

  - Gracely fail when URL resources are not available. Update needed for the
  vignette, when retrieving a specific 'reo'.


Version 1.0.3
------------------------------

MINOR CHANGES

  - Fixed a bug in CEOdata() when raw == FALSE and factor labels are
  not properly passing due to a very strict option in as_factor. Changed
  to levels = "default".



Version 1.0.2
------------------------------

  - Initial production version.
